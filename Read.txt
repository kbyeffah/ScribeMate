## Inspiration

The idea for ScribeMate was born from our shared passion for technology and a desire to improve the quality of marketing materials. We were inspired by a poorly designed marketing flyer we encountered at a cafe, which sparked the idea to create a copywriting tool that could help marketers craft compelling and persuasive content effortlessly.

Copywriting is the art and science of writing text (known as "copy") for the purpose of advertising or other forms of marketing. The goal of copywriting is to persuade readers to take a specific action, such as making a purchase, clicking on a link, donating to a cause, or scheduling a consultation

## What it does
ScribeMate is a Gemini AI-powered marketing copywriting tool designed to empower marketers with the ability to create compelling and persuasive marketing content. With ScribeMate, users can transform their marketing materials from ordinary to extraordinary with just a few clicks, saving time and effort while maximising the impact of their message.

## How we built it
We chose Next.js, TailwindCSS and TypeScript for the front-end framework leveraging its efficiency, scalability and event-driven architecture which aligned with our team's expertise. In addition to our front-end we integrated Gemini 1.5 Pro API  to enrich our chatbot's capabilities. By tapping into these we had access to a wealth of data which allowed for a user to receive accurate and up-to-date information facilitating informed decision-making.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges we encountered during the development of ScribeMate was ensuring that the AI-generated marketing copy was relevant, accurate, and aligned with the user's input. To overcome this challenge, we invested significant effort in crafting precise and well-structured prompts that guided the AI model towards generating content that met the user's specific requirements.

We conducted extensive testing and fine-tuning of the prompts, iteratively refining them based on the generated outputs. This process involved analyzing the relevance and coherence of the marketing copy, identifying areas for improvement, and adjusting the prompts accordingly. By continuously optimizing the prompts, we aimed to minimize irrelevant or off-topic content and ensure that the generated copy accurately captured the user's intended message.

Additionally, we implemented robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle any potential issues that could arise during the communication between ScribeMate and the Gemini 1.5 Pro API. This included validating user inputs, handling edge cases, and providing informative error messages to the users when necessary. By thoroughly testing and refining these error handling processes, we ensured a seamless and reliable user experience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Several companies reached out to us telling us they love our app and have used it for their own marketing campaigns! We're proud of hard work paying off and helping others and our commitment to user-centred design and iterative development throughout the creation process of ScribeMate. Integration of the APIs and fine-tuning so that the AI could gather and provide the user a wealth of data with their marketing content required tremendous effort and at the end, it is always joyous to enjoy the fruits of your hard work.
 
## What we learned
The development experience was an enriching one. we learnt valuable lessons that have deepened our understanding software development, AI and user-centred design. A significant lesson we have learnt was the importance of adaptability & flexibility in face unexpected challenges where we had to reassess our approaches, pivot when necessary and embrace innovation to move forward.

## What's next for ScribeMate
Generally AI chat-bots have separate chat sessions for a user to have different sets of queries with sessions being completely fresh and independent of others. What we plan next is to configure the AI to continuously learn from each user interaction, refining its recommendations based on previous marketing campaigns. This way it could check on what strategies worked and provide users with solutions that work the best.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
